    McDonald orchestrates primitive, largely incomprehensible social rituals
    and sets them in ruined farmhouses or grassy meadows. Though these
    allegorical fictions--including several varieties of romantic entanglement
    and a number of strange ceremonies--verge on the melodramatic arch, the best
    of McDonald's work has a dreamlike quality that suggests both dimly
    remembered ancient rites and elaborately staged mind games.

    I had the pleasure of meeting the artist Anne Arden McDonald at a solo
    exhibition in Brooklyn recently. Anne works in a really wide range of media,
    including photographic prints that she makes both with and without cameras.
    The recent installation includes prints measuring up to 120" in some cases a
    long with smaller prints that feature details. In intricate processes Anne m
    akes contacts prints using various objects, bleaching and manipulating the
    resulting prints (in one case, painted with "medicines, spices and
    household cleaners").

    As a person with almost no patience I am fascinated and in awe of Anne's work.

    Hauntingly romantic yet neither sweet nor saccharine, McDonald's
    photos...retreat into the personal and mystic. It's hard to tell if
    McDonald's lone subject experiences ecstasy, torture, or an out-of-body
    experience, and it is this ambiguity that makes her work so deeply
    provocative. She mediates experiences that cross the tenuous boundaries
    between innocence and dread, birth and death. These pictures cannot be
    digested in one quick glance that appropriates a fixed signifier, nor is
    their surface immediately forthcoming with answers. The prints draw you
    into the picture plane and ultimately lead to the most dangerous place
    that there is--the confines of your own imagination.

    Anne Arden McDonald is one of the best known "unknown" photographers
    around...her images work because of the way they play the edge between
    realism and fantasy without seeming contrived--but are rather the natural
    expression of her sensibility. While her figure, nude or draped, is always
    present, it is so actively integrated into the setting--usually eerie
    landscapes or romantically dilapidated interiors--that the two become one.
    These are subtly surreal, dreamlike images of solitude and escape with an
    atmosphere so timeless it is almost as if the past, present and future are
    happening simultaneously.

    In Installations and Self Portraits, she enacts mysterious rituals in
    which she poses in dreamlike settings...her pursuits seem futile, and yet
    they evoke a psychological or magical quest...the work is refreshingly
    personal in an age of anonymous minimalist photography. Anne Arden
    McDonald has a unique, imaginative photographic voice that calls to us
    from the pages of this book.

    Part of the power of McDonald's self portraits comes from the tension
    between stoicism and exhibitionism in her performances, between fighting
    for control and submission.  Is she the subject or the object in this
    drama, the maker or the made ? ... I found myself wondering if she was
    running away from something--possibly even the viewer ?--or if perhaps the
    viewer was being situated in a position to see something we had no
    business seeing. Several times, despite her framework of opening up her
    performances to us, I thought McDonald's pictures raised issues of
    voyeurism and intrusion on something private.

    For McDonald, landscape and architecture are not only interesting and

    are made real…I wonder if one can say about Anne Arden McDonald that she
    is only a photographer. She certainly falls into the category of artists
    who have found in photography a chance to reflect their own vision. For
    them, photography must grow beyond its usual borders. It is not enough for
    them to use photography as a document or as a vehicle for their concept of
    art, as in Sandy Skoglund's photographs. For Anne, photography is a
    sanctuary in which she preserves her unique world. The image has a life of
    its own, with its own time and space. Simple unusual devices like an
    out-of-focus or blurred picture, or a gestural painting on the
    photographic paper, are a bridge bringing her world to the viewer. Her art
    and photography conjure self-sustaining islands that seem to exist
    independently. For her, photography is not "transparent." It is a screen
    on which the world she created persists.

    <blockquote>
    <p>Photography ages differently than we do. Theoretically it is eternal.
    It does not die with our memories. Photography mocks our flaw of
    passing away. In this regard, it is the quintessence of life,
    joining birth and death into one uninterrupted continuum. The
    evolution of understanding and perception of photography has gone
    through a phase of being treated as a window through which we see
    reality.</p>

    </blockquote>

    Today, photography often projects pictures revealing our imaginary
    version of the real world.  As such, it has ceased to confirm the
    natural world in terms of here and now.  Photography as a projection
    gives us an opportunity to re-enter our memories.  It recalls them in a
    very subjective way, without detracting from their universality. A
    retelling of a memory is flawed because it is uprooted from its context
    in time and place; it is merely a fraction of our life, and it often
    happens that what we consider insignificant or impossible to remember
    and tell becomes possible and significant in photography. A journey into
    the realm of the photographic image becomes phantasmagorical.
    Photography, by showing our memories, gives us a voyage into the land of
    shadows.  The viewer navigates an enclosed space and surrenders to an
    illusion magically fixed in a sheet of photographic paper. They
    participate in an illusion of being there, in that space. It is like a
    piece of a different world which can be conjured up at any moment. New
    incarnations of photography have appeared not just to praise nature's
    creations, but primarily to create new illusions: new, and increasingly
    wonderful, virtual entities.

    One of the important trends in the development of photography has been
    staged photography. Photographers such as Zeke Berman and Ruth Thorne
    Thompsen have built constructions in an enclosed studio. However,
    photographers like Anne Arden McDonald build their arrangements in the
    outdoors, which is annexed to suit the needs of the photograph. This
    artistic approach can be likened to installation art or documentary
    photography, but only in that she works in actual space.  She takes on
    the role of a stage designer, and alters the natural shape and sense of
    each environment, giving it her own, subjective sense. In her series
    Self Portraits, I was interested in the way she reconstructed memories
    in seemingly unknown places which she came across while traveling, and
    in which she saw her hidden dreams or felt provoked to enact mysterious
    rituals. Her performance on the photographic set is suited to the
    character of the landscape or the interior of run-down and abandoned
    buildings. For McDonald, landscape and architecture are not only
    interesting and attractive sets as in filmmaking, but also spaces that
    project a mysterious force and resemble the sacred grounds of
    prehistoric religious cults. These are places where the impossible
    becomes possible, and dreams are made real.

    Through photography, the subject and the space photographed become one,
    joined in the mysterious narrative magically embedded in the picture.
    This fusion is due to an ephemeral and unique moment of immersion in the
    abandoned and empty place, and arrives through a state of tension and
    destruction in the incessant, volatile balance of her body and spirit.
    It seems that photography can lead us to a visual metaphor, to an arena
    where reality and fiction confront each other, which can be interpreted
    in multiple ways. Self Portraits has several layers of meaning. The
    series' wealth relies on the parallel existence of fiction and
    photographic authenticity. Similar symbolic meaning can be found in the
    1997 Group Work series. What is additionally valuable in these
    photographs is that they seem timeless, which challenges our
    predisposition to see a photograph as a freeze-frame of time. This
    series is a story, without a beginning or an end, about something
    difficult to interpret definitely, a story similar to a film narrative
    or a performance art piece. Again: Anne Arden McDonald uses the
    credibility of photography to give evidence of myth. Group Work are
    photographs without a connection to any specific time. If the
    photographs retained the meaning of here, the now has lost all its
    significance. Imagination and the passing of time combine to create myth
    . It turns out that photography is, thus, the creator of myths, but ones
    perversely authentic or incredibly credible. Probably one photograph can
    speak a thousand words, but how to depict silence? Is it possible for it
    to scream in silence like the famous painting by Edward Munch, The
    Scream, from 1893?  When I first saw McDonald’s 1999-2000 Pillow Book
    series, it reminded me of the Munch painting. These photographs depict
    silence and suffering, the mystic figure suffering in silence. We have
    gotten used to “bloody” photographs. There is too much screaming in
    them. Direct and exaggerated expression, often overused in the footage
    of tragic events in the world, no longer affects us. Today, expressing
    silence poses much more of a challenge for a photographer. Anne Arden
    McDonald’s Pillow Book series is much more evocative for a sensitive
    viewer. She uses a simple Diana camera with a plastic lens, which
    results in a fogged, out-of-focus picture. It is just like the reality
    seen through tears and suffering, out-of-focus and fogged. She shows us
    that the suggestiveness of information in a photographic image need not
    be based on exacting technique. Similarly, the carnality in the Pillow
    Book series is not just the surface of the skin touched, but something
    tantamount to a spatial exploration of the whole body, felt by our
    oversensitive consciousness of our existence. A well-focused classic
    documentary photograph “captures” time, and freezes an instant, but is
    too impersonal and thus, less human. An out-of-focus and fogged picture
    better shows perseverance through in time. Because suffering and silence
    last, it seems, indefinitely.

    Anne Arden McDonald used the plastic Diana camera again for her Diana
    Camera Work series. These photographs are the most poetic and nostalgic
    of all of her work that I have seen. They make an impression of being
    paintings dug out of the abyss of the subconscious. They resemble a
    world immersed in oblivion and dreams, where everything can levitate,
    where every object seems to be disappearing, and all we see are the
    traces or shadows which the objects have left. For Anne Arden McDonald
    photography is not only an image, but also an object, which plays the
    role of a fetish where her energy and that of the objects photographed
    accumulate. Anne Arden McDonald often goes beyond the boundaries of
    photography. She makes use of luxography and spills or paints with
    bleach on the photographic paper. The black and white photographic paper
    allows her to capture spontaneous gestures or accidental effects
    resulting from the unconventional and natural coloring of the non-fixed
    light-sensitive emulsion. Images of the micro- and macrocosm appear. She
    uses these photographs for installations like Buoyancy or From Earth to
    Sky, Milan. On the other hand, in her Installation of Little Dresses,
    photographs of the author’s body were transferred onto baby dresses. It
    resembles an intimate archive. Hanging dresses covered in wax are
    brought out from the darkness by interior light, and the whole
    installation makes an impression of illuminated altars of forgotten
    childhood.

    I wonder if one can say about Anne Arden McDonald that she is only a
    photographer. She certainly falls into the category of artists who have
    found in photography a chance to reflect their own vision. For them,
    photography must grow beyond its usual borders. It is not enough for
    them to use photography as a document or as a vehicle for their concept
    of art, as in Sandy Skoglund’s photographs. For Anne, photography is a
    sanctuary in which she preserves her unique world. The image has a life
    of its own, with its own time and space. Simple unusual devices like an
    out-of-focus or blurred picture, or a gestural painting on the
    photographic paper, are a bridge bringing her world to the viewer. Her
    art and photography conjure self-sustaining islands that seem to exist
    independently. For her, photography is not “transparent.” It is a screen
    on which the world she created persists.

    Early in their history, photographers invested themselves with the ability
    to record and posses more than what the world around us showed to them.
    They became interpreters and guides through a parallel universe that only
    they, through their unique medium, could travel to and document in the
    form of photographic records. We, the spectators, cast aside our doubts
    and fears of the unknown and believed in the images because the innate
    realism of photography persevered through even the most bewildering and
    surreal flights of fancy. We looked to photography to provide us not with
    evidence of what we knew, but of what we were missing, what we had
    dreamed of but had forgotten, what we thought we saw out of the corners of
    our eyes.

    Anne Arden McDonald constructs and photographs the unknown. For the
    briefest instant, the subject of the photograph lived and breathed and
    experienced its most critical moment, to be recorded by McDonald’s camera.

    Anne Arden McDonald’s exploration of the unknown allows her images to be
    classified in many ways: as surreal, as fantasy, as self-portraiture; but
    her work is perhaps closest in spirit to that of the Victorian travel
    photographers who tagged along on geological survey expeditions, and at
    the risk of their lives and their equipment, photographed the world out
    there, bringing home to the eyes of a stationary and less adventuresome
    population images of beauty and grandeur, of the bizarre, the unbelievable,
    and the magnificent.

    For Anne Arden McDonald, dreams and reality merge, rather than splitting
    apart. To escape the unbearable feeling of powerlessness to which her human
    limitations confine her, she exceeds them. She imagines herself free to
    float and breathe in the water and to fly in the air. This is a subjective
    vision of a world, a stunningly solitary universe--what parades before our
    eyes is deployed in a mythic space: a sort of non-place, a world that
    lends itself to all the imaginary reconstructions in which a woman who is
    both bird and fish evolves according to her own desires. The expressive
    use of light seeks to capture the unique mystery in which dreams so
    deliciously envelop themselves. For all their extreme precision, these
    black-and-white photographs are imbued with a disturbing lyricism that
    seeks to evoke the ecstasy that is both distressing and dramatic. What is
    seen here as the impulse behind an intimate gesture moves spontaneously
    from the depths to the surface, from the unconscious to the conscious. The
    ascent toward the ultimate and the anguish underlying such an attempt are
    unbearable.

    To escape the unbearable feeling of powerlessness to which her human
    limitations conﬁne her, Anne Arden McDonald exceeds them. She imagines
    herself free to ﬂoat and breathe in the water and to fly in the air. For
    this young artist-photographer, self-representation quickly imposed itself
    as a necessity; even when she was in her teens, this practice provided an
    ideal refuge in which she could extend her field of investigation of dreams.
    To slip away from an immutable terrestrial attachment, she found this
    place of seclusion where she could run free. And thus she began an
    outpouring of dreams in real life...

    <blockquote>The photograph states that the subject is the site, can become the site
    of an internal transformation that will make it not transparent, but
    offered to view.</blockquote>

    Given the many efforts deployed to communicate that which, in spite of
    itself, the subconscious would like to express, one forgets the falseness
    of the premise of “mise en scene” photography. This is the subjective
    vision of a world that ﬁts into an oneiric space, a stunningly solitary
    universe in which the desire to represent oneself to oneself is a divine
    obscenity. It is that which openly, and without modesty, offers itself to
    view and, through this very fact, is disarming.

    Thus, here is an expressionistic photography with a poetic ﬂavour in which
    use of chiaroscuro consigns all immateriality of dreams to the images. The
    expressive use of light seeks to capture the unique mystery in which
    dreams so deliciously envelop themselves. For all their extreme precision,
    these black-and-white photographs are imbued with a disturbing lyricism
    that seeks to evoke the ecstasy that is both distressing and dramatic in
    the very idea of their production. Each photograph provokes a sublime
    sensation in the viewer that might be called exquisite pain--for each
    photograph reiterates, in its own way, the philosophical certainty that
    truth appears only in the light of death.

    What is seen here as the impulse behind an intimate gesture moves
    spontaneously from the depths to the surface, from the unconscious to the
    conscious.
    
    <blockquote>The subject of consciousness is attached to this effect of
    meaning, and capturing it as an image, as a setting of characters in a
    dream, is itself included in the scenario, or better, includes its own
    body.</blockquote>
    
    Captured and trapped, the meaning offered by the subject to the viewer,
    and to the light, is ﬁrst deposited in a darkroom. And, to be revealed,
    the invisible memory is deposited in the very ﬁlter through which it is
    poured. Only the essence of the experience, detached from the mnemonic
    procedure, is retained. One might say of the photographic sign that it
    occurs as much as a residue as an involuntary anamnesis--a memory in
    which the meaning is deliberately, if not unconsciously, lost. In
    photography, it is through its very adherence to the support that, in
    spite of itself, the meaning adopts the status of a sign. The unconscious
    is to the conscious what the camera obscura is to the photographic support.
    Thus, it may be said to be the perfect mechanism for phantasmagoric
    projections.

    What parades before our eyes is deployed in a mythic space: a sort of
    non-place, a world that lends itself to all the imaginary reconstructions
    in which a woman who is both bird and ﬁsh evolves according to her own
    desires. Within this chimerical schema, Anne Arden McDonald adopts
    sometimes the skin of an angel, sometimes that of a siren or other nymphs
    who take on hieratic attitudes and play out their respective fates. For
    example, in the ruins of a temple hall, we witness the fatal consequences
    of Icarus’s fall; his feathers have been scattered by his passage (a
    passage to death) through the ceiling. The submissiveness of attachment to
    the earth is evoked in this image, where the artist represents herself
    bound and immobilized in the centre of a room shot through with light. In
    some works, such as the one where she offers herself as a sacriﬁce to a
    god of ﬁre who encircles her, the evocation of the ritual gesture
    transgresses the sacredness that intrinsically confers its spiritual
    dimension upon all of these photographs. In another image, she swims
    against the current, a siren struggling to mount the waterfall to join a
    floating Ophelia, who is sleeping or perhaps already dead. The ascent
    toward the ultimate and the anguish underlying such an attempt are
    unbearable. The feelings of loss of consciousness and abandonment to dream
    are suggested in the “distraught” wandering of an exiled sleepwalker on
    the rampart of a sumptuous yet austere citadel. The flight through rapture
    is a paroxysm while a muse dances the Sabbath in a fern-flooded
    undergrowth near a shore.

    For McDonald, dreams and reality merge, rather than splitting apart, for,
    if she was unable to take the key to the ﬁelds away with her, she traded
    it for the key to dreams. She shows that it is impossible to exhaust dreams,
    and her quest, although exultant, conceals something inﬁnitely pathetic
    within her. The beauty of such sincerity, which expresses itself naturally
    in...

    the oneiric exodus, recalls somewhat Pascal's famous words to the effect
    that life is but a dream from which we awake only when we die. On the
    other hand, perhaps it is an invitation to flee into dreams. All we have
    to do as imagine ourselves as amphibians, men and women, as creatures in a dream...

  full: >-
    It could be early morning, late at night, the quiet middle of the
    afternoon--your eyes are shut and hours or minutes have slipped past. A
    clock could be ticking on the wall. Dogs could be barking outside. But you
    have relaxed into the landscape of dreams. Gone are the soft cushions of the
    couch on which you are lying. The sun could be burning through your skin but
    you do not feel it. A magazine slips from your fingers, falls to the floor.
    You see nothing of the streets or woods outside your window. In your mind
    you are creeping, soaring, plunging through rooms, forests, oceans. Reality
    uncoils. Rapture gives way to hunger; fear metamorphs into desire. You
    sprout horns, wings. You know neither how nor why you came to be what you are;
    nor do you know what might become of you. But the drama of the moment--
    however strange, tantalizing or frightening--is more visceral than the life
    that you have been living.

    So often our dreams and fantasies transport us to imaginary landscapes where
    we can enact our hopes, fears and desires to an extent not possible in
    ordinary life. The stories and predicaments that flood our consciousness
    during these moments connect us to our most fluid and vulnerable sense of
    self-transformation becomes viscerally possible, and whether that is
    exhilarating, comforting or terrifying depends upon the nature of the dream.
    And yet, when we are extracted from these imagined dramas, we allow this
    fluid sense of self to fade from our consciousness as an unsolved mystery.
    Life is simpler that way; we do not risk our reputations or our lives by
    attempting the suggestions of the imagination, and perhaps this is for the
    best. But surely our sense of self is simplified, if not diminished, by
    letting go so quickly of what our dreams and fantasies reveal. If we were to
    capture these as clearly and as regularly as we do in taking snapshots of
    our ordinary lives, we would gain access to an extraordinary range of human
    experience and expression that we let vanish from our lives daily.

    The tangled dramas and mysterious incarnations of the imagined self are what
    Anne Arden McDonald brings to light through her staged self-portraits. Her
    images open doors to intimate journeys and impulses, quiet illuminations and
    phantasmagoric flights that might otherwise remain private or be forgotten.
    When I look at her self-portraits, I feel the upward pull of imaginary wings
    against the stone weight of my body. Part of me wants to leap out into the

    myself of who I really am, of what I might wish to become, with the same
    sudden clarity of realization that surfaces only when I let go of my
    ordinary self.

    As I turn the pages of this book, I am surrounded by a parade of characters--
    ghosts, spirits, angels, doubles--all McDonald. I see not one imagined self
    but many, each in a constant state of flux, passing from one state of being
    to the next, sometimes quietly, almost imperceptibly, at other times
    violently or joyously. A woman stands alone in the remnants of a darkened
    house, at the threshold of the door, staring into the afternoon sunlight
    onto an expanse of trees that appears intensely wild and alive, an utter
    contrast to her barren surroundings. If only she would step into that strange,
    bright, voracious world, I imagine her life would change forever; but her
    shoes remain rooted to the floor. She is entranced by the freedom outside,
    but the cage-like iron bed frame next to her seems to symbolize the world
    she knows and the place where she will ultimately remain. I recognize that
    combination of longing and hesitation. It brings a tightness to my chest,
    the kind of suffocation that comes when desire is overwhelmed by dread. The
    self in the very next image, however, is a blur of energy and motion;
    unabashedly free, she gives her whole body over to a wild, spontaneous dance
    beneath a stand of tall trees, arms spread, hair and white dress flying. The
    natural world around her seems static and staid in her midst. She stirs in
    me the desire to abandon everything; for her there is nothing but pleasure-
    damp earth, ferns, twigs beneath her feet, nothing will stop her from
    feeling this. This is the type of self I love. One looms in a greenhouse
    where the plants are long dead; she is full of life, hovering like an
    enormous bird for whom there is no dry season or starvation or death, almost
    frightening in her fierce capacity to live. Just as quickly another self
    appears, crouching in a shed, rocks roped to her feet; who or what has
    locked her into this predicament? It does not matter whether the predicament
    is literal, occurring as a moment in real time, or a reflection of the self
    from the inside out. The weight of the rocks is insurmountable; she is
    trapped and grounded, and the light outside so harsh and unforgiving that
    there seems little chance she will survive. 

    With each image, McDonald performs a different self into existence; and it
    is as if in performing one into existence McDonald is no longer what she was
    yesterday, nor the minute before, nor are we the same in looking, with the
    turning of each page, at the selves revealed to us. They present a Pandora's
    box of possibility--and all are real and true at once. The woman who casts
    her reflection into empty rooms, again and again like a vacated shell; the
    woman pushing against walls or pinioned by ropes or swinging like a pendulum
    through a mound of debris; the woman leaping off a hillside with the full
    force of her body as if she could defy gravity--so pure is her desire it
    seems she will succeed, vanishing into the open sky. McDonald neither
    dilutes nor disguises herself with a singular form. Confinement coexists
    with abandon, sterility with transformation, suffocation with flight,
    fragility with strength--she moves between all of these in her self-portraits,
    presenting a broader, more complicated sense of self.  

    By turning the camera inward upon herself, McDonald uses it as a means of
    intensive seeing and revelation. "How do you come to be who you are? How do
    you perform the self into existence?" McDonald asks. To answer this, she
    selects sites throughout the world that elicit "shocks" of recognition: a
    rough hillside, a hellish, gleaming marsh, an abandoned public bath by the
    sea, or the ghosted remains of factories or rooms. She adds and subtracts
    detail--scissors, feathers, rocks--which take us beyond the actual into the
    realm of the metaphorical. But before her images can reach us, she must
    embark on a private journey that extends beyond the frame of the image that
    we see: her re-entry into the fragment of a dream or fantasy, and the
    explosion of that into real time and space. Alone, she performs each
    imagined sequence, taking dozens of exposures by means of a remote control
    device which she clicks on and off, often accidentally, as she moves through
    and inhabits each site. The result may yield only a single compelling self
    portrait. McDonald's victory, however, is that she does encounter and
    inhabit these selves, and she brings back traces of them, captured and
    mounted as figures on the surface that we see. Her use of the camera is an
    exciting reversal of the predatory instance in which photographer and camera
    alike were once thought to capture souls. In such moments, there might have
    been a blast of smoke and a flash of light, followed by the traumatizing
    realization in the subject that the invisible had been breached--that the
    spiritual self had been extracted and claimed, and through alchemy, was now
    imprisoned as a spectre, magically, and seemingly forever, beyond the body
    and will of the subject. To be at the receiving end of such a predatory
    instant, is to be erased. McDonald, however, uses her camera to draw the
    essence out of herself so that we can truly see her, and more importantly,
    so that we might see the world, and ourselves in it, differently. 

    She brings into the open a complex co-existence: the fact that we live in a
    finite, physical body with a mind that dreams. The former is restrained by
    time, biology, society; the latter is outrageous and mysterious. And which
    aspect is more true when we wish to define who we are: the part that we
    inhabit and present daily, or that which surfaces privately and which we
    rarely disclose? To explore the tension between the physical body and the
    uncontainable, provocative spirit, as McDonald does, is to literally stretch
    one's self apart and look inside--an exploration that is at once violent and
    radiant: an act of willed force, and transcendent spiritual release. 

    Seated in a circle of fire, McDonald hunches forward, her back covered in ash;
    she is surrounded by the skeleton of a decaying building, and it seems
    everything will soon collapse around her. Elsewhere, she lies nearly naked
    beneath a giant saw blade that runs the length of her body; if the blade
    were to drop she would be split wide open. Quietly shrouded in cobwebs, she
    lies in the corner of an abandoned room where feathers float from the ceiling;
    a tiny pair of wings spreads from her shoulders. As a human chrysalis, she
    gives no clues as to whether she is entering or leaving this world. Instead,
    she entices us into an eerie state of limbo. Throughout McDonald's images
    there is a constant sense of a world in which things have begun to fall
    apart and transform long ago. I can almost smell the dust and mold in the
    factories and rooms, and feel the dampness peeling layers from the walls.
    But beneath this is a sense of life so unquestioning and persistent that it
    shakes each image alive. That aliveness launches itself outward as a yearning.
    It is as if the selves portrayed here are trying to break through the
    external--buildings, the body, even nature--to reach the spirit. They would
    rather let go of what is familiar and safe, including the physical world
    around them, than risk silencing this. And isn't it true that as human
    beings we often hold on so tightly to who and what it is that we think we
    are that we are constantly in danger of suffocating ourselves. Days and
    years go by and over time it feels as if there is nothing left inside once
    we have met, or have tried to meet, the flood of requirements and
    responsibilities that surround us. To stay afloat, what we hold onto, in
    some cases for a lifetime, is a vacated shell. We no longer listen to or
    dwell in our dreams, desires, and imagination, which are our animating forces;
    and the cost of not doing so is great. We lose sight of our capacity for
    transformation and unlimited becoming. What would happen if we let our
    spirit have its way with us? McDonald challenges us to bring this range of
    expression and emotion into broad daylight and to look at it again and again
    as a way of staying alive.

    McDonald shoots in solitude, and despite the difficulty of her setup and
    procedure, it is rare that she has brought anyone to help or witness. I
    once thought that McDonald's process of "staging" was like the writer's
    process, intimate and alone, and extremely personal. What I have come to
    understand is that McDonald's process of staging her photographs is more
    similar to the actor's process than the writer's process. Despite the
    solitude, her preparation is as public as private, it is as external and
    physical as it is internal, and it is visible in the final product, just
    as the actor's preparation and rehearsal informs the final performance.
    Half of what moves me about McDonald's photographs is the photograph
    itself. The other half is McDonald's preparation and performance of the
    event that is recorded.

    </blockquote>

    Years ago, Anne McDonald showed me a photograph titled Untitled Self
    Portrait Number 3. It is the cover image of this collection, and the first
    photograph of McDonald’s that I had seen, the one that stopped me in my
    tracks and led me to witness her ever-growing body of work. The image is
    emblematic of McDonald’s photography in the early years, what I think of
    as the flying years, in which her images trace the tension of what she
    calls “living in a body with a mind that dreams,” measuring the weight and
    substance of a world that holds the spirit at bay. I repeatedly return to
    this photograph to see her body slicing through the air, a defiant surge
    of life in the somber landscape. The insolence and joy in the act of
    flight catches my breath, lightens my body, and propels me upward in
    tandem with the figure in the photograph.

    This image seized hold of me on that first viewing and draws me to it
    again and again. The figure breaks through the confines of the frame,
    suggesting escape and rupture at the same time. The sheer heroism of the
    gesture changes me, emboldens me, and for a moment, the sharp intake of
    breath and the gathering of muscles is mine. This moment of flight is mine.

    The intimacy of McDonald’s photographs, with their odd, decaying
    landscapes and the solitary figure who is alternately bound and freed,
    wrenches something within me, creating memories of nameless places I have
    been and the experiences I had there, weaving loss, and hope, and struggle
    into a visible document. I look at these photographs and think, These are
    about me. And this is often true of the art that attracts us; it speaks
    profoundly to our own experience, our thoughts, our emotions. It moves us.
    And, certainly, there is much that moves me in a McDonald photograph. Her
    signature landscape, in which she manipulates fire, water, eroding earth,
    and air stirred by flight, creates a mythic environment that feeds my own
    desire to encounter something extraordinary and unknowable. The vulnerable
    and solitary figure that traverses this mythic space has a secret and a
    story to tell, and the longer I look, the closer I think I am to
    unraveling it.

    However, there is something more to these images and the resilience with
    which they have taken hold of me. I change over time, but the photograph
    does not; it is frozen in its moment. And yet each time I return to these
    images, they rise to meet me where I am now, in the present, and they
    seize me as if I had never seen them before. My experience of these images
    is fluid. But how can a photograph, a record of a moment that is tangible
    and unchanging, engage me in such a dynamic relationship? Perhaps I bring
    a new perspective to the image upon repeated viewing, but it is not my
    perspective that McDonald’s images speak to, but my gut, my heart, and my
    secrets. What moves me?

    McDonald calls her images “staged photography,” and in order for the
    photographs to be “staged,” there is necessarily a process of “staging,”
    or performance, involved in the making of them. McDonald and I have had
    many conversations about the creation of her photographs, but I have
    tended to think of the actual shoot as the background or behind-the-scenes
    aspect of the creative process—private, inviolable, and ultimately not
    fair game for examination. McDonald shoots in solitude, and despite the
    difficulty of her setup and procedure, it is rare that she has brought
    anyone to help or witness. I once thought that McDonald’s process of 
    staging” was like the writer’s process, intimate and alone, and extremely
    personal. What I have come to understand is that McDonald’s process of
    staging her photographs is more similar to the actor’s process than the
    writer’s process. Despite the solitude, her preparation is as public as
    private, it is as external and physical as it is internal, and it is
    visible in the final product, just as the actor’s preparation and
    rehearsal informs the final performance. Half of what moves me about
    McDonald’s photographs is the photograph itself. The other half is
    McDonald’s preparation and performance of the event that is recorded.

    <blockquote>
    <p>Staged photography is born out of boredom or dissatisfaction with the world around you—a need to see the world as a place of limitless freedom where anything is possible—you look around you and see what is missing and you build it, create it—giving the world more meaning, more beauty, and more play.</p>

    </blockquote>

    Each of the photographs in this collection documents a single moment of an
    event that is both autobiographical and performative. McDonald’s work is
    rooted in the autobiographical impulse, and her performances are driven by
    her own dreams, desires, fears, and rituals, as well as by events in her
    life. The photographs are performative because of the way she plays the
    shifting line between literal and metaphoric, self and other, real and
    theatrical. She is not simply engaged in self-exploration, but in actively
    shaping this personal material into art. Through performance, the
    autobiographical impulse is transformed into a mythic event that has
    resonance for us, the community that is formed as we bear witness to
    McDonald’s work.

    There are some inherent difficulties in conflating performance and
    photography. Performance is in the present, while the photograph is in the
    past. Performance is evaluated by moment-to-moment truthfulness, the arc
    of the character, the way we breathe with the performer in front of us,
    and the dynamic connection formed between the actor and the audience. We
    might recall individual moments of a performance that were particularly
    strong, but a performance’s effect on us is cumulative, and our
    relationship to it is experiential and shared. A photograph gives us one
    moment and leaves us to fill in the context. Our relationship to it is
    imaginative and solitary. Performance is a continuous composition in time
    and space; photography freezes time and space to form its composition.

    Perhaps the more important difference between a performance onstage and 
    staged photography” is that performance is, traditionally, a live event
    enacted before an audience, and photography is independent of any audience
    aside from that implied by the camera’s eye. One of the more famous, pithy
    definitions of theater which also applies to “performance” is Eric Bentley
    s “A performs B for C,” which is to say, that the actor (A) performs
    something that is not her (usually the character, B) for someone else (C)
    who is also not her. To call an image a “performance” when the performer,
    photographer, and audience are all the same person is to call into
    question the very nature of performance. “Anne performs Anne for Anne.” Is
    this performance? (Bentley, The Life of the Drama, 1975, page 150)

    In the case of McDonald’s work, we are asking the camera’s eye to stand in
    for the audience of the live event—certainly this is always true of
    photography to some degree—and we let the photographer’s eye stand in for
    our own. When we look at the photograph, we see from the photographer’s
    point of view, and his/her vision becomes ours. This “standing in for” is
    one of the powerful mechanisms behind filmed performance and directorial
    style. In a film, we see the world and the performance of the actors
    through the eyes of the director, and in conventional, realistic film
    making, the camera’s gaze is so subtly convincing that it never occurs to
    us that the point of view is any but our own. But unlike most film
    directors (actor-directors being the exception), McDonald is not looking
    through the camera. She looks through it to create the “set,” the
    environment and composition of the frame, but in the act of photographing,
    of the shutter clicking, McDonald is in front of the camera, not behind it.
    The final image is culled from the proof sheets. The “eye” that stands in
    for the audience is no one’s. Or everyone’s.

    Can the audience-performer connection occur after the fact? Can I look at
    the photograph of Anne, frozen in mid-performance, and connect viscerally
    with this moment and character in the past? Logic insists “no,” and yet
    that is what I, as the viewer, seem to be doing and feeling. I seem to be
    there, doing what McDonald is doing and feeling what she is feeling,
    crawling through a crevice toward the light, the dust in my nostrils, the
    weight of the earth holding me back.

    In traditional live performance, we often say human beings naturally
    respond empathically to other human beings. If we trouble to consider
    another person at all, we can only do so by imagining how we would feel if
    we were there instead of here. And this empathic response certainly can
    extend to an image, particularly a photographic image that by its nature
    offers what A. D. Coleman calls “visually persuasive evidence” of its own
    concrete existence. But some photographs are more “visually persuasive”
    than others. In any given photo shoot, McDonald takes between thirty-six
    and one hundred and eighty pictures, one of which may become a final
    photograph. One of these pictures is better than the others. One of these
    performance moments communicates more of what McDonald is feeling. Why?
    (A. D. Coleman, The Grotesque in Photography, 1977, page 75)

    There is always an element of acting in the photographed subject—or at
    least in the subject who knows she’s being photographed. The term “acting”
    is usually applied pejoratively to a photograph to describe the artifice
    of the pose and the self-consciousness of the subject who knows she is
    being looked at. The subject who is acting seems “not natural” or “not
    real,” realism being the home territory of photography. The personas or
    characters created by McDonald require a more sophisticated way of
    thinking about acting in a photograph, a way we usually reserve for theater,
    that speaks to a commitment to the character, honesty, and vulnerability
    in the performance, mastery of a craft, and a kind of energy that is
    larger than life and that is communicating something extraordinary. The
    depth of McDonald’s performance and the focused energy that she brings to
    it is at the heart of what draws us to her images.

    <blockquote>
    <p>I’m interested in the openness. I’m not interested in coming to a place and conquering it. I’m interested in seeing what else I can learn there. I guess the photo shoot is over--or the performance--when I run out of ideas, when there are no more paths to follow, when there’s no more of myself that’s revealing itself out there.</p>
    <footer><cite>AAM</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>

    McDonald refers to the process of making these photographs as “journal
    keeping.” The forty photographs in this collection represent a small
    fraction of the images captured over her fifteen years of staged self
    portraiture. The other images, the ones that did not make it into
    McDonald’s portfolio, form a photo-journal of ideas, emotions, and events
    that have haunted her throughout the years, material that she has needed
    to explore and process. All of the photographs are generated by McDonald’s
    drive toward self-exploration, but as she herself notes, not all of them
    make “good pictures.” While McDonald begins each shoot as a profoundly
    personal exploration, there is a point in the process where the personal
    becomes performative, where a persona begins to develop, and where
    McDonald’s autobiography becomes the mythic narrative that is documented
    in a single print. At what point does the exploration of the raw emotion
    or idea transform into something revelatory and communicative?

    <blockquote>
    <p>I go to a place and that place has a mood and I have a mood and I open myself up to the place and we mix and what comes out of it is never just me or just the place, it’s something in between...it’s a dialogue.</p>

    </blockquote>

    When McDonald encounters a potential space or site for a staged photograph,
    she begins to clear, clean, or shift elements in the space in a process
    that is part ritual and part necessity. An abandoned building might be
    filled with a foot or more of debris and trash, all of which McDonald
    needs to remove before she can work in the space. This process also allows
    McDonald time to experience the space, sense its mood, and discover its
    eccentricities and the possibilities it offers--footholds, windows,
    crevices, a pool of water, a corner where the light falls.

    Once the site is prepared and she begins to improvise in it, she opens
    herself up to the space. For McDonald, this opening means allowing the
    architecture, atmosphere, and history of the space to work on her. It also
    means releasing her dreams, ideas, emotions, fears, body, and voice into
    the space. McDonald’s relationship to the environment is dynamic. When she
    enters the previously abandoned space, she changes it by filling it with a
    human presence. As she begins to improvise and perform in that space, the
    space reciprocates by changing McDonald. Her mood is altered by the mood
    of the space. Her ideas about what she might create there are changed by
    what the space offers her.

    Performance, by its nature, is ephemeral and of its moment, and McDonald’s
    performance in particular has private and ritualistic qualities that make
    it difficult to express. The proof sheets from McDonald’s shoots offer a
    window into the performance that occur in the cleaned and prepared space.
    The still frames from the two to five rolls of film used in each shoot are
    a document of frozen moments that record the performance, and allow for a
    loose reconstruction of the event. McDonald and I have gone through some
    of the proof sheets together, and she has been able to use this record of
    her gestures and movements within the space to describe her process.

    McDonald approaches each shoot and space with a particular feeling or idea
    that reflects something personal in her life. That feeling or idea is
    filtered or shaded by the mood of the space. There are certain psychic and
    physical themes that reappear, such as pressure and release, and flight
    and bondage, as well as certain postures and gestures such as crouching,
    flying, straining against barriers. The beginning of each shoot usually
    involves an improvisation on these themes in the space; a dance or gesture
    sequence, a narrative of abandonment and escape.

    In number 36 of this series, McDonald is costumed in a straight jacket.
    She is trapped in a space in which her only exit is through a group of
    dangling ropes, ropes that she cannot access because her arms are bound.
    The structure in the space is a giant artesian well. The edges are
    slippery and water is forcefully surging into it. In the first two-and-a
    half rolls of film from this shoot, McDonald’s description of her
    movements and actions suggests that her focus is internal or self-reflexive.
    She is exploring her fears of being trapped, misunderstood, and insane,
    drawing sensations from her own life and opening them up to the space.
    Although the environment is influencing the way she is working, the
    driving forces behind the performance are the urgent autobiographical
    concerns. At this early stage of the shoot, McDonald’s focus is more
    internal than external.

    But a change occurs at the end of roll three. At this point, approximately,
    midway through the shoot, the imaginative exploration is interrupted by
    real, concrete demands of the space and situation. McDonald explores
    crossing through the center of the artesian well, and has the sudden
    realization of the actual danger she is in. She is bound in a straight
    jacket and is balancing on a slick surface. She could easily slip into the
    well and not be able to get out. She is alone, and no one can save her.
    The intrusion of immediate danger changes McDonald’s relationship to the
    moment and to the persona she is developing, and she is forced to
    negotiate the fictional and the real, and the internal and the external at
    the same time. The environment demands her attention, because it has
    become an external manifestation of her internal life, of the personal
    theme that she has come to the space to explore. Many of McDonald’s
    performances involve this degree of extreme risk to her person, and this
    real danger quietly informs her creative process. 

    <blockquote>
    <p>I wonder if on some level I really was thinking that if I found the right situation I might be given the ability to fly--I know that at least for the photo shoot, the pain that I felt when I did not lift off the ground was real.</p>
    <footer><cite>AAM</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>

    When actors talk about acting and performance, they often talk about
    “making it real.” They are interested in the fiction that they are
    creating, but they are also very interested in the physical experience an
    actor is having when she creates that fiction. There is always a tension
    between actor and character, between the real and the fictional, and the
    performance event emerges out of that tension. When McDonald realizes she
    is in danger, this awareness subtly influences her performance. The stakes
    become higher because the metaphorical and the real dangers mesh. As a
    result, the way McDonald moves through the space changes; she is more
    cautious and specific in her steps and gestures, and more respectful of
    the power of the space. And when she breaks through those fears and moves
    through the space with reckless abandon, she is overcoming a danger and
    fear that is concrete and immediate. 

    For acting enthusiasts, the often real danger of these shoots places
    McDonald in something akin to an extreme example of a Konstantin
    Stanislavsky exercise of “really” doing the action. What is the difference
    between pretending to look for a lost broach, or really searching for your
    lost heirloom? What is the difference between imagining you could fall and
    actually slipping? One of the challenges of acting is finding the physical
    and emotional sense of really doing it within the fictional world that one
    creates in performance. (Konstantin Slanislavsky, “An Actor Prepares,”
    1936, translated by Elizabeth Reynold Hapgood, pages 31-50.)

    The intrusion of real danger in McDonald’s shoots is one way of sharpening
    her performance, but actual danger is not always necessary, and for the
    safety of McDonald, avoidable wherever possible. What these moments of
    realization have offered McDonald is knowledge about performance. She has
    learned to find non life threatening, real events to fuse with her
    emotions and her imagination. This is perhaps why there are so many
    moments in which McDonald is actually pushing against a wall as if she
    could knock it down, or leaping into the air as if she could fly, or
    tugging against a rope as if she could break it. Those physical acts are
    real, and the effort that she puts into them is real. The ideas and
    emotions that are internal are given real expression by the actual
    striving force of her body.

    Much of McDonald’s work stems from her frustration with the limitations of
    the human body, but her performances are not simply a denial or wishing
    away of those limitations. Instead, her performance is grounded in
    confronting and overcoming physical limits. In the many images in which
    McDonald is floating or flying, she does not simply imagine herself to be
    weightless. Instead, she exerts the enormous amount of physical energy
    needed to climb a wall and balance on an imperceptibly small ledge, and
    then transcends that force and tension to create and perform a narrative
    of ease, airiness, and escape. It is in the act of transcending physical
    limitations that the images are born. McDonald’s photographs are
    mysterious, mythic, and fantastical, but I think that part of what makes
    them resonate for us is that they also seem, somehow, real. When I look at
    Untitled Self-Portrait Number 3, it is not the idea of flying that moves me;
    it is McDonald’s physically rigorous act of projecting her body into the
    air that seizes me and thrusts me upward alongside her. Flight is no
    longer a fantasy, but a reality, performed into existence by McDonald’s
    defiance of the physical. It is the act of defiance and transcendence that
    moves me, and that offers me a moment in which the “real” world gives way
    to McDonald’s “world of limitless freedom where anything is possible.”

    Looking through this book, I revisit my intense interest in certain
    themes: flying and transcending bodily limitations, tension and struggle, hope and
    freedom, vulnerability, and ritual. I have many images that came directly
    from events in my	life, played out in symbols in a location that I
    transform into a temporary stage. I have left the prints untitled so as to
    not interfere with the open-endedness of the narratives and to encourage
    people to take these images into their own lives. What I have noticed over

    have touched on some universal themes, and the closer I get to myself, the
    more people tell me it resonates with them as well.

  title: Afterward
  full: >-
    The story of my self-portraiture begins in the summer when I was about
    eight years old. I had just taken a bath, the sun was setting, and my
    mother was taking pictures of my cousins and my brother and me in the
    backyard of my grandparent’s house on Long Island. The amber light was in
    my hair and my nightgown. I felt radiant and beautiful and I wanted to
    hold on to that feeling. I wanted mom to take a picture of me so I could
    see what I looked like when I felt that way.

    Questions of identity have always intrigued me. Am I my body and face, or
    am I my mind and thoughts? What is the germinating source of my ideas, and
    who is home to receive them? Am I who I am to you or to myself? These are
    simple questions, and still we carry them all of our lives. Who am I? Why
    am I here? How much of who I am is shaped by the fact that I am female,
    growing up in this time period, in this culture, and born to these parents?
    Or a reaction to all of this? And how much of this will I ever get to know
    before my life comes to an end?

    When I was fourteen years old, I began making pictures of myself. I was
    growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, attending a conservative religious school,
    and I was in conflict with almost everyone around me. I believed that if I
    could make a beautiful picture of myself, make many copies, and pass them
    around, people would see me differently and my life would change. These
    first images were somewhat different from the ones you see here—I was
    dressed in a straw hat, in a red cashmere sweater, smiling with a rose—but
    I really believed in the power of the photograph to alter my life for the
    better. A few years later I began working with self-portraits more
    seriously. I was curious about things I had not been exposed to and
    rebelling against what I had been exposed to. I photographed myself as a
    runaway, a prostitute, a homeless person. I began breaking into abandoned
    buildings because it was risky and exciting, but also because I felt at
    home there.

    Growing up, I felt out of place. I was born in London, and I thought that
    if I could return somehow, I would be among people who were more like me.
    I also remember thinking I was on the wrong planet, that my freckles were
    a map to the place where I belonged, and when I found the planet where my
    freckles lined up with the stars in the sky, I would be home. By the time
    I left high school, I felt my childhood and my self-image had slipped out
    of my hands, dictated to me by a group of people outside myself. When I
    entered college, I felt I was again being judged by my fellow classmates,
    but this time their response was positive. I made a number of self
    destructive images in response to this where I looked fat, ugly, angry, or
    crazy, which was the way I saw myself at the time. I used these images to
    reassure myself I was still the same person, so I could take in the new
    messages about myself more slowly. 

    My relationship to my self-portraits is complex and layered. They are part
    self-discovery and therapy, part performance and escapism, and partially a
    response to the spaces that I work in. They span fifteen years of my life
    and function as something of a visual journal for the years I was making
    them. Looking through this book, I revisit my intense interest in certain
    themes: flying and transcending bodily limitations, tension and struggle,
    hope and freedom, vulnerability, and ritual. I have many images that came
    directly from events in my life, played out in symbols in a location that
    I transform into a temporary stage. I have left the prints untitled so as
    to not interfere with the open-endedness of the narratives and to
    encourage people to take these images into their own lives. What I have
    noticed over the years is that while my exploration began as a personal one,
    I seem to have touched on some universal themes, and the closer I get to
    myself, the more people tell me it resonates with them as well. I do not
    see this as ironic, although there are ironies here. Would you believe
    that I hate being photographed ? It’s also funny because I don’t identify
    with my body or my face, but I use my body to express my ideas. I rarely
    use my face as it can be so emotionally loaded that it becomes distracting.
    I have learned to use body gestures instead as they are more subtle.

    The locations where I shoot make up a large portion of the final photograph,
    and so have a major impact on the atmosphere of the image. Usually I work
    in moody landscapes and abandoned interiors. These locations I find
    compelling on many levels—I like the smells and textures as well as the
    feeling of time passing, of history and entropy and decay. I wasn’t
    conscious of it at the time I was making them, but I was also connecting
    with part of myself in these places—in childhood I felt left behind and
    forgotten. These spaces are a metaphor for me. I tune in to the mood of
    the locations that I shoot in by spending time there, and I alter them as
    a way of connecting with the place, and by extension the world around me.
    This interaction marks the space as mine, anything from leaning a few
    boards in a corner of a room to building a whole installation there. I
    also remove garbage to make the locations look more timeless. These
    buildings often have a churchlike atmosphere, like a space that has died.
    The vaulted warehouse ceilings have become still and quiet, the activity
    and energy they were built to house has moved on. This is the perfect
    atmosphere for enacting ritual. In the case of my photographs, a living
    person rises like a phoenix from the rubble against the backdrop of a
    building that is in the process of falling into ruin.  

    Photography is the perfect medium for suggesting narrative because
    photographs are always out of context. The viewer is asked to weave the
    story of what happened before and after the picture was taken. I think
    this medium is also perfect for inciting fantasy because most people
    believe in photographs in a way that they wouldn’t have to if the images
    were paintings; black and white photography works well because it is one
    step removed from our everyday experience. In my work, each image evokes a
    story, but there is also an overall narrative of struggle, tension,
    patience, and loss when I am indoors; and flying, freedom, and movement
    when I am in the landscape.  As a group, these images show a passage out
    of darkness into light. I have burned through a great deal of emotion to
    find peace.

    When I was a child and things around me became too painful, I would run
    away into worlds I had invented where I could be safe and free. In the
    self-portraits I see myself transcending daily life, my upbringing, even the
    constraints of living in a physical body. I have a very symbiotic
    relationship with the person I become in my photographs. She has
    characteristics I want, and she has led me in some interesting directions.
    I began collecting antique clothing to wear in my photographs and ended up
    wearing it in real life. When I could not identify with anyone around me,
    she helped me build a self from scratch using myths, literature, and
    daydreams as source material. In some ways, I feel that I have come full
    circle with this body of work: I wanted to make a beautiful picture of
    myself, make many copies, and try to use it to draw people toward me. As
    it has worked out, I have met many of my close friends through my work. As
    Alice says in Jan Svankmajer’s film of the same name, “I think it worked
    quite well, though not entirely as I’d expected.

    "So much of today's photography fails to touch upon the hidden life of the
    imagination," once lamented the great American photographer Arthur Tress.
    "Where are the photographs that we can pray to, that will make us well
    again, or scare the hell out of us?" Anne Arden McDonald tries to answer
    his request with mystical evocative images that go well beyond the
    limitations of documentary photography. Combining performance,
    self-portraiture, and installation, McDonald constructs visions of her own
    imagination that are nonetheless as real and truthful as the artist's own
    states of emotion.

    McDonald's work is a testimonial to the human condition, being of spirit
    and flesh; desiring flight and being earthbound. She addresses the risks
    and sensibilities of the female identity. The female figures are courageous,
    vulnerable, and passionate examples of strength within the violent and
    ever-changing forces of time.

    London-born Anne Arden McDonald, now of New York, creates high drama by

    urban structures. The results are romantic, theatrical and risky.

    McDonald's wildly sensual self portraits are overrun with suggestions of

    In her most recent works taken using a Diana camera...she limits herself
    to photographing fragments of objects, faces and landscapes. And yet,
    thanks to velvety prints with depth, she succeeds once again in
    transforming her images into something mysterious and secret. It is as if
    these fragments had become a sort of collection of memories and
    recollections emerging from the distant past. It is as if the photographed
    objects had maintained their presence as things, while at the same time
    opening up to another life pervaded by dreams, drenched in silence and
    suspended in some mysterious time.

    I build installations in the landscape or in abandoned interiors and then
    make private performances for my camera that are part ritual, part dance,
    and part daydream. I have many fantasies—being able to fly is the main one
    and am frustrated by the limitations of an earthbound body. This is a
    dilemma—being both flesh and spirit; living in a body with a mind that
    dreams.

    In the beginning, I never really set out to make artwork. I was brought up
    in a very conservative southern community, went to a born-again Christian
    school, and was in conflict with just about everything around me. The
    southern ideal of femininity is a narrow road to ask women to walk. I may
    not have known it at the time, but making these pictures was about survival.
    I had to ﬁgure out my life and to build a self that I could live with.
    That’s when I began deliberately using the camera.

    I had a little Instamatic from the time I was about six, and for sixth
    grade graduation, I was given a 35mm camera. I had an idea that if l made
    one beautiful picture of myself I could give copies of it to everybody I
    knew, and my life would change. I never got that picture, but I continued
    using the camera to explore myself. Since I was not like the “model
    female" in magazine and advertising photographs, and I wasn’t like anyone
    I knew, I started trying to ﬁgure out who I was and how I could relate to
    the world around me.

    I began shooting in abandoned buildings because they were a metaphor for
    feeling left out and forgotten. Also, they have a history, a texture, a
    feeling, and a smell that work on my imagination. I go through a ritual of
    getting rid of debris and sometimes I do an installation using objects
    left behind, like old shoes, or tools. It‘s a way of creating a theater
    where some part of me will be performed into existence. The characters are
    all some little piece of me that became magnified through the ritual and
    through the physical work of making pictures. Sometimes I spend quite a
    long time setting up a space. By the time I begin shooting, my mood has
    become physical, and it‘s straight off the nervous system. I try to use my
    body to express my spirit, to find meaning and symbolism in a world that
    has paved over some of its magic. Usually I have drawn or written some
    ideas to work with. But most often what I get is the picture between the
    ideas, something that reveals a subtler mix of emotions that comes from
    interpreting a feeling rather than performing a pre-constructed narrative.

    In 1992, I attended a summer workshop at the Prague House of Photography,
    in the Czech Republic, and encountered many photographers there doing
    staged photography, working in a way similar to what I had been doing. I
    thought I’d find a lot of documentary photography because they were
    involved in one of the biggest guinea pig experiments of our century, in a
    way, with communism. The Czechs have a rich tradition of surrealism—in the
    language, in filmmaking, in fairy tales, even in their architecture—that
    comes through in their photography. I think one of the things I have in
    common with the Czech and Slovak photographers I've become friendly with
    is this escapism from harsh realities. For them, it was communism; for me,
    it was southern conservatism.

    Looking at this series all together recently, I saw that the indoor scenes
    are mainly about struggle, waiting, and loss. Often the character looks
    towards a window or door, as if searching for a way out or for contact
    with a world outside. I found I had burned through so much emotion that I
    had arrived at a peacefulness and realized that I didn‘t have to make
    these pictures anymore. Over the ﬁfteen years in which I made these
    photographs, they changed from being personal therapy to representative
    symbols. My images serve as a visual metaphor for struggles we face every
    day: tension and balance, keeping hope alive against obstacles, and living
    in a vulnerable way without being crushed.

    Anne Arden McDona|d is an artist who works in a wide range of mediums,
    including photography (with and without cameras), sculpture, drawing, and
    installation. She is best known for her self-portraits that reflect her
    interest in installation and performance. She talks with EYEMAZ/NG about
    her most recent project.

    <strong>Hilaire Avril (for EYEMAZING)</strong>: What was the initial spark
    for your Pillow Book series?

    <strong>Anne Arden McDonald:</strong> I began shooting while I was
    traveling through Europe, exhibiting the self-portrait series. I would
    take pictures with the Diana [camera] wherever I went, not really knowing
    what I would get out of the process. Later on, Radek Grosman and I started
    working on this series; it grew out of images he had begun about bodies in
    distress. It's probably the only collaborative work I've ever done that
    was really successful, because I think I'm a little bit of a control freak
    and it's really difficult to make space for another person in my process
    in general. But Radek and I are best friends, and we just honoured each
    other's ideas. Any idea that came up, we would try it, without judging it
    first. We would do and perform everything that the other person would come
    up with, and edit it later. That was essential. For most of that series,
    he was the model. He and I both came up with gestures, poses, locations,
    props and costumes. It was pretty mutual, flowing back and forth between us.
    I would have an idea; he would tale off from that idea, or vice versa.

    <strong>HA: </strong> There's work shot in Italy, the Czech Republic, New
    York and other places. What guided you in your choice of location and
    moments for the series?

    <strong>AAM: </strong>It was similar to my approach for the self-portraits.
    I was after a background with a texture, often a location that was an
    abandoned building with a history, a mood, a flavour and a smell that was
    very specific. I'm very fond of working in abandoned buildings because I
    like connecting with the history and the texture, wondering about who was
    here, what might have happened in this place. It has a lot of richness. I
    find working in a studio very difficult, because you have to bring in
    everything.<br />
    Working in an abandoned building means you have to deal with daylight, you
    have to carry a compass to see when the sun might come through this window
    the way you need it to. There are limitations, but there's a lot of
    fertility in decay.<br />
    I think in the self-portraits as well as Pillow Book, there's imagery of a
    phoenix rising from the ashes. There's a tension between the building
    being in this desolate condition and this person who's doing something
    evocative. A tension between being potentially repulsed by the location
    and being attracted to the subject. It's a really fertile place to work.

    <strong>HA: </strong>Why did you call the series "Pillow Book">

    <strong>AAM: </strong>There were two people at FotoFest in Houston years
    ago who had a crush on Radek. We had been making this series for a while
    at that point. I made a little collection of images, and sent them a copy
    in book form, which I called Pillow Book because I was teasing them for
    having a crush on my boyfriend.

    <strong>HA: </strong>You shot the Pillow Book series with a "Diana,” the
    1960s plastic box camera that uses 120 mm film. How did that affect your
    work?

    <strong>AAM: </strong> I probably have to back up a little bit, because
    most of my bodies of work have begun in one place and then moved into
    another. I came into photography by doing self-portraiture. I began when I
    was fourteen years old. I think the reason that there are so many
    different bodies of work on my website (www. anneardenmcdonald.com) is
    that I get different appetites. I get hungry for different types of
    challenges. I also do sculpture, and jewelry, and at the moment I'm
    working on giant, process-based photographs (on my website in the "New Work"
    section).<br />
    I shot the self-portraits with a 35 mm camera for a long time. I printed
    them fairly neutrally, not warm-toned, because they are a little bit
    romantic, but I didn't want them to go too far in that direction. I
    printed the Dianas much warmer, because it was a much more dreamy and
    romantic body of work.<br />
    When I started shooting with this camera, what I liked about it is that it
    brought a little bit of chaos and recklessness to the photographic process,
    because you lose so much control, between not being able to frame the
    camera (the Diana's viewing device and the shutter are in different places)
    and having to aim up by several percentages, which can be confusing. Also,
    you have to learn to compose in a square; there is no metering, and very
    little aperture or shutter speed control. I ended up shooting entire
    series of pictures on the "b" setting, which gives a certain amount of
    camera shake. That's one of the things I love about this camera, it's fuzzy,
    and also the tones it gives when you print them. The whites become really
    milky and the darks become like a charcoal drawing. The vignetting
    reducing the image's brightness at its edges) makes everything look like
    it's coming out of a dream, or from under water. It gives it an unusual
    aspect, but it was what I was looking for at the time, I wanted to create
    mood without narrative, and the fuzziness of the lens was a good match for
    the vague imagery I wanted to create.

    <strong>HA: </strong> The Diana does seem like a temperamental camera, how
    do you control it?

    <strong>AAM: </strong>I think that's the whole point, to give up control.
    You really can't control it. It helps to have a lot of practice with
    another camera. It gives you a sense of metering without carrying the
    device. But even with the 35 mm camera, I shoot a little bit "by ear". I
    listen for the length of the shutter speed. To me it's like music, I'm
    listening to a rhythm. I probably shot 100 rolls a year with the Diana for
    many years. With practice, you get to know when you're going to need, say,
    a five to ten second exposure, which is a lot of hand-holding, but 1 got
    used to it after shooting for so long in areas without a lot of light.
    There's something really beautiful that happens around the edges of the
    film with the Diana. About half of my cameras will draw this very specific
    little white line along the bottom or sometimes on the side of the film,
    which is probably a reflection inside the plastic camera body. It gives it
    a little bit of a highlight when you print it, and makes the picture look
    a little bit like a bubble, almost three-dimensional, off the page... a
    bit like a, Polaroid effect you can't control. But it’s beautiful, that
    line looks like drawings by Schiele.

    <strong>HA: </strong> Is printing a large part of your process?

    <strong>AAM: </strong>Yes, it is an elaborate process. I dilute my
    developer, so it gives the prints much warmer tones than usual. It's a
    long developing time, but it gives the print a milky aspect. I also use a
    semi-mat surface, so it looks a little bit like skin. For the past seven
    years, I've been investigating processes by which images can be made.
    Because I also sculpt, and I'm a little bit jealous of painters, who talk
    to paint and paint talks back to them, it's a dialogue. Photographers
    rarely get to have that type of a dialogue. So I take a piece of 50-inch
    wide, 100-foot long photo paper on which I build a layer of eggshells and
    a pile of glass, and then run around the perimeter, with a flashlight to
    make the exposure. I then run it through the chemistry to see what I got.
    I've been inventing sculptural methods to make photographic images, which
    is now much more exciting for me than printing with the enlarger in the
    darkroom.

    <strong>HA: </strong> Are you still l working on the series?

    <strong>AAM: </strong> Yes, I suspect we might do some this summer,
    because I'm meeting Radek in Italy in July. We made some pictures in Cairo,
    in Egypt, a year ago, so we'll see. Whenever we get together, we tend to
    work together.

    <strong>HA: </strong> Will Pillow Book be published?

    <strong>AAM: </strong>I do have plans to publish all of my plastic camera
    work. One group of work is more iconic, one is more travel imagery, and
    then there is Pillow Book, which is the only series with a person in it.
    It has a very different mood, romantic, and it's usually about a body in
    some state of tension.

    <strong>HA: </strong>Where have you shown the series? 

    <strong>AAM: </strong>I haven't shown it that often, just a bit in the
    Czech Republic. People enjoyed it very much. My self-portrait work is
    really what made me an artist and a photographer. I still think of it as
    being identified with me. From fifteen to thirty-years of age--I grew up
    with that work. But then, some people have told me that Pillow Book was
    the best work I've ever done.
