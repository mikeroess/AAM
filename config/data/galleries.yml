    The Atom Planet series explores ways of generating an image on
    photographic paper without using a camera or negative. The dialogue that
    occurs between painters or sculptors, and their chosen medium is one source
    of inspiration for inventing processes that inform the resulting photograph.
    Another is the scientific method, where you observe phenomena, formulate a
    hypothesis, test it with experiments, use careful measurements, note
    variables, observe results, and then use this information to build an
    image.

    While still working with photo paper, light, and chemistry, I use some
    well-known processes like the photogram, and invent other ways of producing
    images without using a negative. Some of these methods include painting
    bleach onto blackened photo paper, or building layered piles of glass and
    eggshells and moving around them with a flashlight to make an exposure. In
    one image over 100 medicines, spices, and household cleaners were painted
    onto photo paper and run through regular photographic chemistry to test for
    colors and textures. The methods are often an unorthodox collection of
    materials and techniques from the domestic and scientific realms brought
    into the darkroom, often coaxing or scrubbing, evaporating or decaying, an
    image into the paper.

    Using glue as a resist and digging down to the photo paper surface with
    alternating photo chemicals causes an image to emerge on the paper in the
    form of a chemical painting. Some images are made in the dark and some in
    daylight, some processes are additive and others reductive. After
    developing these processes and using them to make a series of giant (50 x
    111 inch or 125 x 280cm) photographs, the imagery emerges as circles and
    spheres, meant to represent planets and atoms, to visualize the macrocosm
    and the microcosm of life as we know it. The scale has a relationship to
    abstract expressionist painting; I am often physically in the piece while
    building it, exploring it as if it were a terrain or landscape. The scale
    is also impacting the subject matter, the work more often explores the
    cosmological realm than the atomic, but this obsession with circles is also
    related to a search for a sense of wholeness.

    These giant camera-less photographs pose some interesting questions about
    what photography is, and what it can be. Photography is a young medium, and
    there is so much undiscovered terrain. We stand at a precipice: digital
    photography is eroding the availability of some of the analogue materials
    that photographers have employed, and it’s important to experiment
    quickly while the materials are still available.

  statement: >-
    This series investigates the body and its relationship to the person who
    lives in it: as a location of evolution and change; of growth, learning and
    metamorphosis, but also of aging and disease. The images illustrate
    conceptions of the body, using life-sized silhouettes on 50 inch wide, 8-12
    foot tall silver gelatin photo paper. The prints are created without
    negatives by unique processes, mostly by making photograms and/or by
    painting with chemistry and bleach on photographic paper. The images have
    been exhibited as individual photographs and as a site-specific
    installation. As an installation, the room is lit by a life-size sculpture
    of a body undergoing a metamorphosis, wrapped in a chrysalis. The body is
    illuminated from the inside with Christmas lights and is made of chair
    stuffing material and tattered fabric. The installation was created for the
    Month of Photography in Bratislava, Slovakia in 2006, the wall text from
    the exhibition is below.

    This piece is an installation about the body and its relationship to the
    person who lives in it--as a location of evolution and change--of
    growth, learning and metamorphosis, also of aging and disease--

    There are as many lenses through which to see the body as there are people
    doing the looking--and all of these complex layers exist simultaneously--

    There is the physical body--skin, bone, blood, hair, colors, textures--

    And the products of the body--sweat, tears, urine, blood, spit, feces--

    The body as animal, an organism with a certain matter--height and weight--

    The systems of the body--breath, digestion, blood flow, nerves,
    reproduction, lymph--

    The body as liquid, gas and solid--osmosis, structure, pathways, tides,
    ebb and flow--

    The body in motion, even when at rest--the rhythms of the body--
    peristalsis, urges, metabolism, gesture, stimulation--

    The energetic body--heat, radiation, vibration, charkas, light,
    magnetism, electricity, synapses, aura, acupuncture meridians--

    The body as a site for individual personality, emotion, consciousness,
    courage, thoughts, needs, dreams--

    The body is abstract (the place we call us is a cluster of cells) and very
    real and concrete at the same time, especially in times of pain--

    The metaphoric body--symbols help us visualize the abstract nature of the
    place we call home--body as a temple, body as landscape--seeds and
    eggs--the heart as a center of feeling, the breath as a small wind--

    The body as site for connection, and communication, in relation to others,
    to the outside world--influences pour in, tumble out--the vibration of
    the voice--

    The body in growth and decomposition--miracle and tragedy--like a
    plant, bloom and die and return to earth--

    What is the nature of the animating force we call life? What is a soul, a
    spirit? Where is it before we are born, and where does it go when we die?
    What energy moves the body and keeps it from being a pile of flesh? If I
    cut off my arm, is my arm still me? Am I my body and face or my mind and
    thoughts? What is the germinating source of my ideas and who is home to
    receive them? Am I who I am to you or to myself? These are simple
    questions, and still we carry them all of our lives--Who am I? Why am I
    here? How much of who I am is shaped by the fact that I am female, growing
    up in this time period, in this culture, and born to these parents? Or a
    reaction to all of this? How much of who I am is due to the chemical makeup
    of my body? And how much of this will I ever get to know before my life
    comes to an end?

    As Darwin said, it’s not the smartest or the strongest that will survive,
    but the ones most adaptable to change--

    I build installations in the landscape or in abandoned interiors and make
    private performances for my camera in these spaces. The performances
    explore my relationship to the world around me and are part ritual, part
    dance and part daydream. I have many fantasies that I cannot actualize in
    everyday life--flying is the most insistent of them--and I feel frustrated
    by the limitations of an earthbound body.  This is a dilemma we all share:
    being both flesh and spirit, living in a body with a mind that dreams. My
    images serve as visual metaphors for struggles we face each day: tensions
    and balances, the necessity of keeping hope alive despite the obstacles,
    and the challenge of acknowledging our vulnerability without being crushed.

    All images are silver gelatin prints, 16 x 20 or 8 x 11 inches.

    This series is about vagueness and half-remembered subconscious images.
    Each of these pieces is part of a visual poem which, when seen as a whole,
    creates a sensation of falling or floating. These images look like the ones
    I see when waking from a dream, they arrive half-remembered through a
    sleepy mist, and take on symbolic importance as my waking reality tries to
    uncover their meaning or weave them into a coherent narrative. With this
    series I am trying to build on mood that eludes the specifics of narrative.

    All images are silver gelatin prints, 8 x 8 inches.

    <h4>Note on the Diana camera--</h4>

    I am using a plastic Diana camera, a children’s camera from the 1950s, to
    get this hazy, off-balance look. This device has a special optic which
    causes the images to be slightly fuzzy and vignetted; the effect is perfect
    for producing moody photos that look like they are coming out of the
    subconscious or up from under water. Because the lens is uncoated for color
    correction, the whites are milky and the darks resemble a charcoal drawing.
    I am often shooting on the bulb setting, which makes the image even more
    nebulous due to the camera shaking slightly. I enjoy the uncertainty of
    these images; I appreciate the room for interpretation afforded by the
    indefinite.

    This series is a collaboration with Radek Grosman; it grew out of a series
    he had begun about bodies in distress. We worked in abandoned spaces to
    give the image the tension between identifying with the body’s sensuality
    and vulnerability while recoiling from the rawness and subtle menace of its
    surroundings. This series was shot close to the figure, as Radek had begun
    it, and shot with the Diana camera, which gives the images a somewhat
    spiritual atmosphere.

    All images are silver gelatin prints, 8 x 8 inches.

    When I travel, I come across gardens and pathways, pieces of romantic
    landscape that I respond to and which work well with the Diana camera's
    translation of their imagery. This camera makes it difficult to locate an
    image in time, making it easier to create an image that transcends
    historical context.

    All images are silver gelatin prints, 8 x 8 inches.

    <h4>Note on the Diana camera--</h4>

    I am using a plastic Diana camera, a children’s camera from the 1950s, to
    get this hazy, off-balance look. This device has a special optic which
    causes the images to be slightly fuzzy and vignetted; the effect is perfect
    for producing moody photos that look like they are coming out of the
    subconscious or up from under water. Because the lens is uncoated for color
    correction, the whites are milky and the darks resemble a charcoal drawing.
    I am often shooting on the bulb setting, which makes the image even more
    nebulous due to the camera shaking slightly. I enjoy the uncertainty of
    these images; I appreciate the room for interpretation afforded by the
    indefinite.

    This is a series of tiny sculptures which are built inside antique pocket
    watch cases. Many of them address time as a theme, but not linear time, so
    much as our experience of it: expansion or compression, nostalgia and
    memory, cycles and seasons. The watches also explore how we measure time:
    musical time, celestial time, arrested time, and the passage of time.

    Working with objects which have textures, colors, and evidence of wear and
    history provides a unique richness, as does witnessing how the fragments
    impact each other. Viewing these sculptures is like looking through a glass
    into a miniature world where objects are having a private dialogue. Some of
    them have moving parts, the viewer is welcome to interact with the pieces
    to obscure or reveal different meanings, giving them a dynamism that cannot
    be conveyed by a still image.

    * Probably worth a mention that most of these cases come from standard-issue
    watches given to early railroad conductors, and some of the backs are
    engraved with images of trains. Before the railroad, it was typical to have
    a local time that was different from town to town, but to avoid crashes,
    time was standardized, and for a while this was known as "railroad time."
    These cases themselves were a footnote in the history of our changing
    relationship to time.

    Watches are 2.5 inches in diameter.

    This installation contains a photo paper ceiling, which I blackened and
    painted with bleach to created an image of the universe--complete with
    planets, stars and nebulae. From that paper sky I suspended about 500
    threads with needles on the ends. Two large clouds, lit from the inside,
    hovered in the middle of the room and the needles dangled just above the
    clouds, and outlined them. The floor was dusted with olive pollen, and
    under the clouds I placed 300 orange, grapefruit and apple seeds, cast in
    bronze and polished. For me it was as if the pain of the needles passing
    through the enlightenment of the clouds had produced the golden seeds on
    the floor.

    The room was about 10x14 feet.

    <h4>Note on Installations</h4>

    For 15 years, from the age of 15 to 30, I would go to a space, often an
    abandoned building, build an installation there, and do a self portrait
    performance for my camera. The end result was a photograph, but over time I
    realized was that I was giving people a window into what I saw and felt and
    experienced. From there I progressed to building site-specific
    installations so as to give people the direct experience of the mood and
    environment I had formerly created on film. These installations are staged
    in a small room with a particular quality of light; usually the whole space
    is treated so the experience becomes immersive. There are often organic
    forms and some photographic materials: sometimes there is a smell (as from
    the olive pollen); and often there are elements you can engage with,
    deliberately or by accident. These environments are hard to document
    accurately: you can get a sense of what it looked like but not what it felt
    like to be there.

    Governor's Island, Summer 2008

    This installation was formed around ideas of gravity and weightlessness,
    delicacy and heaviness, and mark-making and drawing. I made a series of
    cyanotypes (Victorian blueprints) by contact printing baby and doll
    dresses. I made additional dresses out of feathers, paper, eggshells,
    cotton, seeds, leaves, hair, twigs, etc; contacted printed them, and made a
    ceiling out of both types of images. There was also a 6-foot-tall dress
    hanging in the room with a giant hoopskirt so that children (and adults)
    could go up under it and see the light passing through the layers of
    tattered antique fabric and lace. I then covered the floor with papers and
    pencils so people could draw, and had one area by a window where 15 plumb
    bobs were hung at different heights. The ones that touched the paper
    scrawled marks as if the breeze from the open window was drawing. My intent
    was to make an installation that felt summery and airy and nautical, a mood
    created by the theme and the colors, to harmonize with the island setting.

    When I stopped taking self portraits, I started making pictures of pairs of
    people and groups of people: exploring issues that couples face and what we
    are like as a society, questions of whether we hold each other up or let
    each other fall. This was a new challenge because making the self portraits
    had been an internal process and the group portraits were more directorial.
    These are platinum prints made from digitally enlarged negatives, with a
    tremendous amount of help from Mark Katzman in St. Louis. A few are
    silver gelatin prints, and all are 16 x 20 inches.

    To make these images, I place small translucent objects on the negative
    plane of the enlarger, and contact print other objects actual size on the
    easel plane. The result is multi-layered rayograms, which are printed onto
    positive sheet film, and shown as light boxes in a dark room. I use the
    natural light falloff from the enlarger to enhance the effect of looking
    into a microscope or a petri dish at a tiny secret world. In creating this
    series I felt like a scientist: evaporating liquids and building sculptures
    out of glue to print through.
 
    All prints are on 20 x 24 inch sheet film, exhibited as light boxes.

    The series "Buoyancy" is about lightness and optimism, about the energy
    that comes to us from out of nowhere. It is about objects rising and
    floating, about the planets mysteriously suspended in silence. In this
    show, I wanted to make representations of the microcosm and the macrocosm
    of life as we know it—the planet and the cell—and relate them to bubbles
    and a feeling of expansive joy and hope.
 
    "The photograph is the terrain" --Barbara Shinn

    The pieces in this installation have been created without negatives (with
    the exception of the X-rays). The photo paper was painted with layers of
    developer, then was fixed and bleached to construct images: a process both
    additive and reductive. This way of working is spontaneous, gestural and
    surprising—-things happen that I cannot explain. Photo paper has an
    incredible range of memory, so anything I do, I have to live with or
    attempt to bleach out.

    The 4 long thin pieces are 8 feet tall, and the globe is 10 x 16 feet.

    This series is alchemical, the result of a process I can’t explain. I
    took very old photo paper and poured developer over it in a tray in the
    dark, then poured the developer off, and stood the tray in a corner in the
    darkroom so it was fogging under a safelight while I did other work. I
    poured the developer over the paper a few more times over several hours,
    then at some point I placed my hand on the paper. Either the heat activated
    the developer, or the hand oils functioned as a resist, somehow a handprint
    would materialize. I think these images are reminiscent of aural
    photography, or the hands that American Indians left on walls in the
    desert. The paper was never exposed to any light other than a safelight.
 
    All images are on 11 x 14 inch silver gelatin paper.

  statement: >-
    The first time I ever thought of making an installation, I was motivated by
    the desire to achieve a quality of light that embodied feeling of
    nostalgia. In 1994, in the middle of winter, at a studio given to me by the
    Sharpe Foundation in New York, I took antique children's dresses and
    printed images of myself on them with liquid emulsion, then dipped them in
    wax and lit them from the inside with a few tiny Christmas lights. The
    installation consisted of a dark room with little glowing dresses hanging
    on tiny hangers, with long waxy drips hanging down. The piece was more
    about the internal mood and the quality of warm dim light in the room than
    it was about any one individual dress or image: it evoked memory as a soft
    yet perpetual radiance.

    The first mural consists of multiple images of me jumping, made by
    enlarging and reducing an actual photo, and then collaging the xeroxes.

    The second one was made from a negative self portrait and a positive image
    of flames, dropped into slide projectors and printed on mural paper (the
    final image is about 6 by 8 feet). I look like a monster because I had put
    phosphorescent paint on my face and upper body, charged myself up under the
    lights, and shut the lights off. I am the light source for the image and
    the eyes and mouth are black where there was no paint.

    To make the exploding man image, I shot a negative of a piece of graffiti,
    and many slides of flames, dropped them each into slide projectors and
    printed a collaged image onto mural paper. The final image is about 8 by 15
    feet.

    These are done by swirling the tongs in the developer over a piece of photo
    paper that has been exposed to light (but no negative). The results
    resemble charcoal drawings: the stringy ones look like cells dividing, like
    meiosis-mitosis, or at times they evoke bubbles, rolling and rising and
    falling.

    All prints are on 16 x 20 inch silver gelatin paper.

    title: 'Atom, Planet: Camera-less Photography'
    text: >-
      While most photography employs a lens, and either film or a digital sensor,
      this series explores ways of generating images on photographic paper
      without using a camera or negative. The source of inspiration for inventing
      processes that inform the resulting photograph is the dialogue that occurs
      between painters or sculptors, and their chosen medium. Another is the
      scientific method, where you observe phenomena, formulate a hypothesis, test
      it with experiments, use careful measurements, note variables, observe
      results, and use this information to build an image.

      While still working with photo paper, light, and chemistry, I revisit some
      historic processes like Man Ray’s photogram, Pierre Cordier’s chemigram,
      and lumen printing, and also invent other ways of producing images without
      using a negative. These processes are utilizing optical situations, or
      chemical reactions, or a combination of the two. Applying glue as a resist
      and digging down to the photo paper surface with alternating photo chemicals
      causes an image to emerge on the paper in the form of a chemical painting.
      Some of these camera-less experiments include painting bleach onto blackened
      photo paper, building layered piles of glass and eggshells and moving around
      them with a flashlight to make an exposure, and growing a self-replicating
      garden of mold that feeds on silver gelatin paper. In one image, over 100
      medicines, spices, and household cleaners were applied to photo paper and
      run through darkroom chemistry to test for colors and textures. The methods
      are an unorthodox collection of materials and techniques from the domestic
      and scientific realms, brought into the darkroom, often coaxing or
      scrubbing an image into the photographic paper. Some images are made in the
      dark and some in daylight, some processes are additive and others reductive,
      the result is a series of giant (50 x 111 inch) and many smaller
      photographs. The imagery emerges as circles and spheres, meant to represent
      planets and atoms, to visualize the macrocosm and the microcosm of life as
      we know it.

      The scale has a relationship to large painting; the physical demands of the
      area being treated require a bodily presence in the piece while building it,
      exploring as if it were a landscape. The scale impacts the subject matter,
      the work more often addresses the cosmological realm than the atomic, but
      this obsession with circles is also related to a search for a sense of
      wholeness.

      Photography is a very young and exciting medium, and there is so much
      undiscovered terrain. In some ways, it stands at a precipice: digital
      photography is eroding the availability of some analog materials, and the
      study and use of silver gelatin papers. I am working to develop these
      processes, and to pose interesting questions about what photography is, and
      what it can be.
