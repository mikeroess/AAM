		<strong>Botanical Book</strong>

		I found an old American Express ledger book from 1904 in a flea market, and I began preserving botanical objects between the pages in the late 90s. In recent years I have been printing through the pages onto photo paper, using the pages as a giant paper negative. A few of the images are included here, they are printed on 11 x 14 inch paper.
