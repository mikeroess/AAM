	<strong>Group Work, 1997</strong><br />
</p>
<p>When I stopped taking self portraits, I started making pictures of pairs of people and groups of people: exploring issues that couples face and what we are like as a society, questions of whether we hold each other up or let each other fall. This was a new challenge because making the self portraits had been an internal process and the group portraits were more directorial. These are platinum prints made from digitally enlarged negatives, with a tremendous amount of help from Mark Katzman in St. Louis.â€¨A few are silver gelatin prints, and all are 16 x 20 inches.
