	<strong>Travel and Garden Diana</strong>
</p>
<p>When I travel, I come across gardens and pathways, pieces of romantic landscape that I respond to and which work well with the Diana camera’s translation of their imagery. This camera makes it difficult to locate an image in time, making it easier to create an image that transcends historical context.	<br />

All images are silver gelatin prints, 8 x 8 inches.

<p><strong>Note on the Diana camera--</strong></p>

<p>I am using a plastic Diana camera, a children’s camera from the 1950s, to get this hazy, off-balance look.  This device has a special optic which causes the images to be slightly fuzzy and vignetted; the effect is perfect for producing moody photos that look like they are coming out of the subconscious or up from under water. Because the lens is uncoated for color correction, the whites are milky and the darks resemble a charcoal drawing. I am often shooting on the bulb setting, which makes the image even more nebulous due to the camera shaking slightly. I enjoy the uncertainty of these images; I appreciate the room for interpretation afforded by the indefinite.</p>
